/*********************************************************************
 * All MoveIt 2 headers have been updated to use the .hpp extension.
 *
 * .h headers are now autogenerated via create_deprecated_headers.py,
 * and will import the corresponding .hpp with a deprecation warning.
 *
 * imports via .h files may be removed in future releases, so please
 * modify your imports to use the corresponding .hpp imports.
 *
 * See https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/pull/3113 for extra details.
