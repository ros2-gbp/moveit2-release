  /** \brief Compute the sequence of joint values that correspond to a straight Cartesian path for a particular link.

     The Cartesian path to be followed is specified as a \e translation vector to be followed by the robot \e link.
     This vector is assumed to be specified either in the global reference frame or in the local
     reference frame of the link (\e global_reference_frame is false).
     The resulting joint values are stored in the vector \e path, one by one. The maximum distance in
     Cartesian space between consecutive points on the resulting path is specified in the \e MaxEEFStep struct which
     provides two fields: translation and rotation. If a \e validCallback is specified, this is passed to the internal
     call to setFromIK(). In case of IK failure, the computation of the path stops and the value returned corresponds to
     the distance that was achieved and for which corresponding states were added to the path. At the end of the
     function call, the state of the group corresponds to the last attempted Cartesian pose.

     During the computation of the path, it is usually preferred if consecutive joint values do not 'jump' by a
     large amount in joint space, even if the Cartesian distance between the corresponding points is small as expected.
     To account for this, the \e jump_threshold argument is provided. If a jump detection is enabled and a jump is
     found, the path is truncated up to just before the jump.

     Kinematics solvers may use cost functions to prioritize certain solutions, which may be specified with \e
     cost_function. */
