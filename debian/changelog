  * Cleanup lookup of planning pipelines in MoveItCpp (#1710 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1710>)
    * Revert "Add planner configurations to CHOMP and PILZ (#1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522>)"
    * Cleanup lookup of planning pipelines
    Remove MoveItCpp::getPlanningPipelineNames(), which was obviously intended initially to provide a planning-group-based filter for all available planning pipelines: A pipeline was discarded for a group, if there were no planner_configs defined for that group on the parameter server.
    As pointed out in #1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522>, only OMPL actually explicitly declares planner_configs on the parameter server.
    To enable all other pipelines as well (and thus circumventing the original filter mechanism), #1522 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1522> introduced empty dummy planner_configs for all other planners as well (CHOMP + Pilz).
    This, obviously, renders the whole filter mechanism useless. Thus, here we just remove the function getPlanningPipelineNames() and the corresponding member groups_pipelines_map_.
  * Fix clang-tidy issues (#1706 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/1706>)

  * remove debug printfs
  * planning_scene_monitor: add requestPlanningSceneState()
  * planning_scene_monitor: fix race condition
  * planning_scene_monitor: fix state update bug
    The rate of state updates is limited to dt_state_update per second.
    When an update arrived it was not processed if another was recently
    processed.  This meant that if a quick sequence of state updates
    arrived and then no updates arrive for a while that the last update(s)
    were not seen until another arrives (which may be much later or
    never). This fixes the bug by periodically checking for pending
    updates and running them if they have been pending longer than
    dt_state_update.
  * add default_robot_link_padding/scale, set padding/scale value for each robot link, see https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ros/issues/402
  * fix LockedPlanningSceneRW docs
    fix the text that was originally copied from another class
