  * banish bind()
    source:https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/3106/commits/a2911c80c28958c1fce8fb52333d770248c4ec05; required minor updates compared to original source commit in order to ensure compatibility with ROS2
  * Merge https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/424a5b7b8b774424f78346d1e98bf1c9a33f0e78
  * Merge #3081 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/3081>: Improve Gazebo-compatible URDF generation in MSA

  * Merge https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/commit/ab42a1d7017b27eb6c353fb29331b2da08ab0039
  * Move getGazeboCompatibleURDF() from MoveItConfigData to SimulationWidget
    This is a function specific to the SimulationWidget
  * Provide button to open original URDF file
  * Fix widget layout
  * Use focusGiven() + focusLost() to generate and validate Gazebo URDF
  * XmlSyntaxHighlighter: allow nested highlighting
  * Replace manual highlighting with a SyntaxHighlighter
  * Simplify getGazeboCompatibleURDF()
    Use a new utility function uniqueInsert() to avoid code duplication
    when inserting XML elements uniquely.
  * getGazeboCompatibleURDF(): Compare original and final XML
    Instead of manually keeping track of changes, compare the two docs.
    This is much more robust.
  * getGazeboCompatibleURDF(): Skip catching YAML exceptions
    There is no YAML involved!
  * fixup: config_path_ -> static const CONFIG_PATH
  * fixup: Simplify saving
    - new_gazebo_urdf_ -> save_gazebo_urdf_
    - directly save content, avoid extra parsing
    - hide overwrite button if doc is empty
    - disable overwrite button if saving is not possible due to xacro
  * fixup: Drop hidden_func_ from ConfigurationFilesWidget
    but (re)create the list of to-be-generated files each time
    entering the widget to allow for dynamic adaption of the file list

  * Do not automatically load robot description in move_group.launch (#3065 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/3065>)
    MoveIt should not overwrite a previously uploaded robot description.
    It should only provide it optionally in demo mode.

    Implement ACM defaults as a fallback instead of an override.
    Based on ros-planning/srdfdom#97 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/97>, this allows disabling collisions for specific links/objects by default and re-enabling individual pairs if necessary.
  * MSA: Add STOMP + OMPL-CHOMP configs (#2955 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2955>)
    - Add stomp planner to MSA
    - Add OMPL-CHOMP planner to MSA
    - Remove obsolete CHOMP parameters
    - Update CHOMP config parameters to match code defaults
    - Create CHOMP config via template (instead of code)
    Co-authored-by: Robert Haschke <mailto:rhaschke@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de>

    * Convert bind placeholders
    grep -rlI --exclude-dir=.git " _[0-9]" | xargs sed -i 's/ _([0-9])/ std::placeholders::_1/g'
    * Update bind include header
    grep -rlI --exclude-dir=.git "boost/bind" | xargs sed -i 's#boost/bind.hpp#functional#'
  * MSA: Notice file updates (#2964 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2964>)
    This commit fixes a MSA bug causing files in a loaded MoveIt config to be incorrectly classified as externally modified
    after being written by the "Generate Package" button.
    As this status is solely based on the file timestamp relative to the timestamp stored in the .setupassistant file,
    we need to update this timestamp when we wrote the files.
  * Upload controller_list for simple controller manager (#2954 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2954>)
  * 1.1.6
  * Various improvements to MSA: #2932 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2932>, #2945 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2945>, #2946 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2946>
  * Pilz: Define default planner
  * Simplify definition of planning_plugin parameter
    There is no means to declare the planning_plugin as an arg first.
  * Allow checking/unchecking multiple files for generation
  * Improve instructions
  * moveit.rviz: Use Orbit view controller
  * moveit.rviz template: remove link names
  * Rename launch argument execution_type -> fake_execution_type
    ... to clarify that this parameter is only used for fake controllers
  * gazebo.launch: delayed unpause
    Only unpause simulation when robot model was loaded.
    This ensures that the initial pose is actually held.
  * gazebo.yaml: Allow initial_joint_positions
  * gazebo.launch: Load URDF via xacro if neccessary
  * Modularize demo_gazebo.launch: draw on demo.launch
  * demo.launch: start joint + robot-state publishers in fake mode only
    This will facilitate re-use of demo.launch.
  * Formatting
  * Fix controller choice
    - Provide all types of JointTrajectoryController as well as
    FollowJointTrajectory and GripperCommand (use by simple manager)
    - Use effort_controllers/JointTrajectoryController as default
    - Create FollowJointTrajectory entries for any JointTrajectoryController
  * Simplify code
  * Update widget texts to speak about generic controllers
  * Rename ROSControllersWidget -> ControllersWidget
  * Rename files ros_controllers_widget.* -> controllers_widget.*
  * Rename ros_controllers_config_ -> controller_configs_
  * Rename functions *ROSController* -> *Controller*
  * Rename ROSControlConfig -> ControllerConfig
  * Fix ros_controllers.yaml: always handle joints as sequence
  * Rework controller config generation
    We should write separate controller config files for different controller managers:
    - simple_moveit_controllers.yaml handles everything relevant for SimpleMoveItControllerManager
    - ros_controllers.yaml handles ros_control config
    - gazebo_controllers.yaml handles controllers required for Gazebo
  * Add gazebo_controllers.yaml
  * Fix handling of sensors_3d.yaml
    - Reading both, the default and the existing package's sensors_3d.yaml
    into the config, the config file was growing by 2 configs each time.
    - Not visiting the Perception tab, was writing the default config with 2 entries
    - Selecting "None" was writing an invalid config:
    sensors:
    - {}
    - {}
  * Cleanup generation of ros_controllers.yaml
  * Rework moveit_controller_manager handling
    There are 3 basic MoveIt controller manager plugins:
    - fake = moveit_fake_controller_manager::MoveItFakeControllerManager
    Used in demo.launch. Doesn't really control the robot, but just
    interpolates between via points. Allows these execution_types:
    - via points: just jumps to the via points
    - interpolate: linearly interpolates between via points (default)
    - last point: jumps to the final trajectory point (used for fast execution testing)
    - ros_control = moveit_ros_control_interface::MoveItControllerManager
    Interfaces to ros_control controllers.
    - simple = moveit_simple_controller_manager/MoveItSimpleControllerManager
    Interfaces to action servers for FollowJointTrajectory and/or GripperCommand
    that in turn interface to the low-level robot controllers (typically based on ros_control)
    However, so far move_group.launch distinguished between fake and robot only.
    The argument moveit_controller_manager now allows switching between all 3 variants.
    Adding more *_moveit_controller_manager.launch files allows for an extension of this scheme.
  * Fix definition of real-robot moveit_controller_manager
    Fixes the following error (occurring since 61d18f2f073aa4c8a13c2278c41a63591d401c4a)
    ```
    [FATAL] ros.moveit_ros_planning.trajectory_execution_manager:
    Exception while loading controller manager 'robot':
    According to the loaded plugin descriptions the class robot
    with base class type moveit_controller_manager::MoveItControllerManager does not exist.
    ```
    As we introduced pass_all_args="true", the value of the argument
    moveit_controller_manager was the robot name.
  * Remove execution_type argument from real-robot controller_manager.launch
  * moveit_controller_manager.launch: pass execution_type via pass_all_args (#2928 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2928>)
    While we need to pass execution_type to fake_moveit_controller_manager.launch,
    the controller_manager.launch files of real-robot shouldn't be required
    to define this argument. However, if they don't roslaunch fails with an
    unused args exception (see #2786 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/issues/2786>).
    Passing arguments via pass_all_args should solve that issue.

    The warning message was accessing the config_data_ variable, which
    was assigned just a few lines later.
